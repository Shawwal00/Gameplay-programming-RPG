    // Create a circle where if the player steps into the circle The cube will go to the player, Use the Unity pathfinding 
    // If the square reaches the player then attack based on a parameter
    // If the player runs away then the enemy returns to its location
    
    // Later try to develop my own pathfinding if I have time
    
    // If the Cube is hit 3 times then it breaks into 2 smaller cubes then again with 2 hits then 1 hits
    
    // Add a Lock on for the camera
    // Add multiple cubes that communicate with one another so they do not all attack the player.
    
    // Have the player Be able to be killed and respawn at a location
    // Add visual effects for clear emphasis
